Description:

This project is an AI-powered Ambulance Dashcam System designed in python to detect and fine vehicles that obstruct ambulances in emergency transit. It combines real-time computer vision, automated fine generation, and a web dashboard to enhance emergency vehicle priority on roads. The system helps enforce traffic laws by leveraging object detection, vehicle tracking, and license plate capture, ensuring ambulances are given the right of way without delay.
